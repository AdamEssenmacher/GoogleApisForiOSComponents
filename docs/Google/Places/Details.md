Attribution Requirements
========================

If you use the Google Places SDK for iOS in your application, you must include the attribution text as part of a legal notices section in your application. Including legal notices as an independent menu item, or as part of an "About" menu item, is recommended.

You can get the attribution text by making a call to `Google.Places.PlacesClient.OpenSourceLicenseInfo`

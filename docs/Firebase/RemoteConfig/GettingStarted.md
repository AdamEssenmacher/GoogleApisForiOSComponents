## Firebase Remote Config API Overview

Firebase Remote Config has APIs that make it easy to change the behavior and appearance of your app without requiring users to download an app update. This overview describes the following:

* Key features of the Remote Config APIs.
* The Remote Config library and API architecture.

### Key Features of the Remote Config APIs

Remote Config APIs implement the following features:

* **Your app controls when new parameter values are applied:** Because changes to parameter values affect the behavior and appearance of your app, the API design implements a singleton object that fetches values in the background, caches them, and then lets your app activate them at the right time.
* **In-app default parameter values:** You set in-app default values for all Remote Config parameters in your app. These values are available to your app immediately, even if a device does not have connectivity. You get fetched and activated values using the same methods that you use to get in-app default values.
* **Fetching and applying values is efficient:** Fetching and activating values from the Remote Config Server is efficient and can be done safely and repeatedly, so there is no need to add logic to your app that listens for a callback or that determines if it is safe to activate fetched values. In fact, you can write your app so that it sends a request to fetch parameter values and activates any previously fetched parameter values each time that a user starts your app, or even more frequently than that. If no fetched and activated values are available, your app will use in-app default values with a negligible impact on performance from the fetch request or the call to `ActivateFetched`.

### Remote Config library

The cornerstone of the Remote Config API architecture is the Remote Config Library. The Remote Config Library implements a singleton class, the `RemoteConfig` class. Use the Remote Config object to do the following:

* **Set default values:** You don't need to manage (or even create) parameters in the Remote Config service for your app to work as intended. You can instrument your app with as many Remote Config parameters as you need and create in-app default values. Later, you can override a subset of your app's parameters by creating parameters on the Remote Config Server.
* **Fetch, store, and manage parameter values:** The Remote Config object contains three stores of parameter values: the **Default Config** (stores in-app default values), the **Active Config** (stores values that are available to the app using get methods), and the **Fetched Config** (stores values most recently fetched from the Remote Config Server).
* **Activate the Fetched Config, which updates the Active Config:** When the Fetched Config is activated, the parameter values in the Fetched Config are copied to the Active Config. This makes the recently fetched values available to your app.

### API architecture

The following diagram shows how your app interacts with Remote Config:

![Firebase_Remote_Config_API_Architecture](https://firebase.google.com/docs/remote-config/images/api-use.png)

The following table provides additional details on interactions between your app and the Remote Config Library:

| Methods and properties | Notes |
|------------------------|-------|
| Get Remote Config object property: `SharedInstance` | Step #1: Your app calls this property to get the Remote Config object (or have it recovered from persistent storage). If the object was newly created, the Fetched Config, the Active Config, and the Default Config are initially "empty," containing no parameter values. |
| Set Default Config method: `SetDefaults` | Step #2: Your app calls this method to set values in the Default Config. If your app attempts to get a value from a new Remote Config object before that value exists in the Active Config, the value from the Default Config is provided instead. |
| Fetch method: `Fetch` | Your app uses this method to initiate a call to the Remote Config Server and obtain fresh parameter values, which are stored in the Fetched Config. <br /> **Note:** Fetch method do not have an immediate effect on the behavior or appearance of your app. |
| Activate method: `ActivateFetched` | Your app activates the Fetched Config, which copies values stored there to the Active Config. |
| Get\<type\> method: `GetConfigValue` | Your app calls this method to get parameter values from the Active Config. |
| Config settings method: `RemoteConfigSettings`' constructor | Used for custom settings. Currently only used for settings that allow app developers to refresh app data more quickly than is allowed for production apps. |
| Info methods and properties: `LastFetchTime` | Your app uses this property to get information about the Remote Config object. You can use these methods for debugging during app development. |

> _**Note:**_ _Some Remote Config methods allow you to specify a namespace. These methods are reserved for future use. You do not need to specify a namespace to use Remote Config._

## Add Firebase to your app

1. Create a Firebase project in the [Firebase console][1], if you don't already have one. If you already have an existing Google project associated with your mobile app, click **Import Google Project**. Otherwise, click **Create New Project**.
2. Click **Add Firebase to your iOS app** and follow the setup steps. If you're importing an existing Google project, this may happen automatically and you can just [download the config file][2].
3. When prompted, enter your app's bundle ID. It's important to enter the bundle ID your app is using; this can only be set when you add an app to your Firebase project.
4. At the end, you'll download a `GoogleService-Info.plist` file. You can [download this file][2] again at any time.

## Configure Remote Config in your app

Once you have your `GoogleService-Info.plist` file downloaded in your computer, do the following steps in Xamarin Studio:

1. Add `GoogleService-Info.plist` file to your app project.
2. Set `GoogleService-Info.plist` **build action** behaviour to `Bundle Resource` by Right clicking/Build Action.
3. Add the following line of code somewhere in your app, typically in your AppDelegate's `FinishedLaunching` method (don't forget to import `Firebase.Core` namespace):

```csharp
App.Configure ();
```

## Add Settings to Remote Config class

Create settings for `RemoteConfig` class, you can enable developer mode to allow for frequent refreshes of the cache (don't forget to import `Firebase.RemoteConfig` namespace):

```csharp
// Enabling developer mode, allows for frequent refreshes of the cache
RemoteConfig.SharedInstance.ConfigSettings = new RemoteConfigSettings (true);
```

## Set in-app default parameter values

You can set in-app default parameter values in the Remote Config object, so that your app behaves as intended before it connects to the Remote Config Server, and so that default values are available if none are set on the server. You can achieve this with a **.plist** file or with an **NSDictionary** variable.

### Set in-app default parameter values with .plist file

In your Xamarin Studio app project do the following steps to add default parameters with .plist file:

1. In your project app name do Right click/Add/New File...
2. In **New File** dialog, select iOS tab and choose Property List
3. Name the Property List as you want and click **New**
4. Change the **Build ACtion** of your just created file to **BundleResource** by Right clicking it/Build Action
5. Open your **.plist** file and add all the parameters that you want.

After you have setup all your default parameters, set the **.plist** to the `RemoteConfig` class:

```csharp
RemoteConfig.SharedInstance.SetDefaults ("<Your plist name here>");
```

### Set in-app default parameter values with a NSDictionary

Instead of using a **.plist file** to load default parameter values to your app, you can create a `NSDictionary` to load them:

```csharp
object [] values = { 5, 20 };
object [] keys = { "times_table", "from_zero_to" };
var defaultValues = NSDictionary.FromObjectsAndKeys (values, keys, keys.Length);
RemoteConfig.SharedInstance.SetDefaults (defaultValues);
```

## Set parameter values in Firebase Console

1. In the [Firebase console][1], open your project.
2. Select **Remote Config** from the menu to view the Remote Config dashboard.
3. Define parameters with the same names as the parameters that you defined in your **.plist** file or in your **NSDictionary**. For each parameter, you can set a default value (which will eventually override the in-app default value) and you can also set conditional values. To learn more, see [Remote Config Parameters and Conditions][3].

## Fetch and activate values from the server

After you have setup your parameter values in your app and in your server, you are ready to fetch those values in your app from the server so you can override your local values. Call `RemoteConfig.Fetch` instance method to retrieve values from server and call `RemoteConfig.ActivateFetched` instance method to make fetched parameter values available to your app:

```csharp
// CacheExpirationSeconds is set to CacheExpiration here, indicating that any previously
// fetched and cached config would be considered expired because it would have been fetched
// more than CacheExpiration seconds ago. Thus the next fetch would go to the server unless
// throttling is in progress. The default expiration duration is 43200 (12 hours).
RemoteConfig.SharedInstance.Fetch (10, (status, error) => {
	switch (status) {
	case RemoteConfigFetchStatus.Success:
		Console.WriteLine ("Config Fetched!");
		
		// Call this method to make fetched parameter values available to your app
		RemoteConfig.SharedInstance.ActivateFetched ();
		
		// Update your UI from here
		...
		break;

	case RemoteConfigFetchStatus.Throttled:
	case RemoteConfigFetchStatus.NoFetchYet:
	case RemoteConfigFetchStatus.Failure:
		Console.WriteLine ("Config not fetched...");
		break;
	}
});
```

## Use parameter values

The way you can use parameter values in your app is by calling `RemoteConfig.GetConfigValue` instance method or using `RemoteConfig` indexer method:

```csharp
var myValue = RemoteConfig.SharedInstance ["myKey"].NumberValue;
var myOtherValue = RemoteConfig.SharedInstance.GetConfigValue ("myOtherKey").StringValue;
```

## Caching and throttling

Remote Config caches values locally after the first successful request. By default the cache expires after 12 hours, but you can change the cache expiration for a specific request by passing the desired cache expiration, in seconds, to `Fetch` method. If the values in the cache are older than the desired cache expiration, Remote Config will request fresh config values from the server. If your app requests fresh values using `Fetch` several times, requests are throttled and your app is provided with a cached value.

During app development, you might want to refresh the cache very frequently (many times per hour) to let you rapidly iterate as you develop and test your app. To accommodate rapid iteration on a project with up to 10 developers, you can temporarily add a `RemoteConfigSettings` property with `IsDeveloperModeEnabled` set to true to your app, changing the caching settings of the `RemoteConfig` object.

## Use Firebase Remote Config with Analytics

When you build an app that includes both Firebase Remote Config and Google Analytics for Firebase, you gain the ability to understand your app users better and to respond to their needs more quickly. Read this [Firebase documentation][6] to learn more about this.

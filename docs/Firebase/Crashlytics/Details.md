## Key capabilities

|  | |
|-:|-|
| **Curated crash reports**   | Crashlytics synthesizes an avalanche of crashes into a manageable list of issues, provides contextual information, and highlights the severity and prevalence of crashes so you can pinpoint the root cause faster. |
| **Cures for the common crash** | Crashlytics offers Crash Insights, helpful tips that highlight common stability problems and provide resources that make them easier to troubleshoot, triage, and resolve. |
| **Integrated with Analytics** | Crashlytics can capture your app's errors as **app_exception** events in Analytics. The events simplify debugging by giving you access a list of other events leading up to each crash, and provide audience insights by letting you pull Analytics reports for users with crashes. |

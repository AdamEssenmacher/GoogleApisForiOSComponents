# AdamE.Firebase.iOS.Core

.NET bindings for Firebase Core on Apple platforms.

## Scope

Firebase app initialization, options, app lookup, logger configuration, data collection defaults, and shared Firebase types.

These packages are thin bindings over the native Firebase Apple SDK. The native documentation is the source of truth for product behavior, Firebase console setup, quotas, policy requirements, and feature workflows.

## Native Documentation

- Firebase Apple setup: https://firebase.google.com/docs/ios/setup
- Firebase Core documentation: https://firebase.google.com/docs/ios/setup

## Package

- Package ID: `AdamE.Firebase.iOS.Core`
- Managed namespace: `Firebase.Core`

Supported target frameworks include:

- `net9.0-ios`
- `net10.0-ios`
- `net9.0-maccatalyst`
- `net10.0-maccatalyst`

When multi-targeting, condition package references so they restore only for Apple targets:

```xml
<ItemGroup Condition="$([MSBuild]::GetTargetPlatformIdentifier('$(TargetFramework)')) == 'ios' Or $([MSBuild]::GetTargetPlatformIdentifier('$(TargetFramework)')) == 'maccatalyst'">
  <PackageReference Include="AdamE.Firebase.iOS.Core" Version="x.y.z" />
</ItemGroup>
```

## Binding Notes

Use the official Firebase Apple docs for setup and usage. In .NET, call the equivalent APIs from the managed namespace listed above. Keep app-specific Firebase configuration, such as `GoogleService-Info.plist`, in the application project.

Binding-specific caveat: Most Firebase feature packages require the application to configure Firebase according to the official Apple setup docs before calling feature APIs.

## Version Alignment

Firebase Apple SDKs are packaged as native xcframeworks. Applications should pin package versions intentionally and keep all `AdamE.Firebase.iOS.*` packages on the same major/minor Firebase line.

Avoid mixing unrelated Firebase binding package sets or mismatched Firebase native SDK lines in one application. That can cause duplicate symbols, linker failures, runtime loading failures, or undefined native SDK behavior.

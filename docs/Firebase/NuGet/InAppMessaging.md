# AdamE.Firebase.iOS.InAppMessaging

.NET bindings for Firebase In-App Messaging on Apple platforms.

## Scope

In-App Messaging display, trigger, and message APIs exposed by the Firebase Apple SDK.

These packages are thin bindings over the native Firebase Apple SDK. The native documentation is the source of truth for product behavior, Firebase console setup, quotas, policy requirements, and feature workflows.

## Native Documentation

- Firebase Apple setup: https://firebase.google.com/docs/ios/setup
- Firebase In-App Messaging documentation: https://firebase.google.com/docs/in-app-messaging

## Package

- Package ID: `AdamE.Firebase.iOS.InAppMessaging`
- Managed namespace: `Firebase.InAppMessaging`

Supported target frameworks include:

- `net9.0-ios`
- `net10.0-ios`
- `net9.0-maccatalyst`
- `net10.0-maccatalyst`

When multi-targeting, condition package references so they restore only for Apple targets:

```xml
<ItemGroup Condition="$([MSBuild]::GetTargetPlatformIdentifier('$(TargetFramework)')) == 'ios' Or $([MSBuild]::GetTargetPlatformIdentifier('$(TargetFramework)')) == 'maccatalyst'">
  <PackageReference Include="AdamE.Firebase.iOS.InAppMessaging" Version="x.y.z" />
</ItemGroup>
```

## Binding Notes

Use the official Firebase Apple docs for setup and usage. In .NET, call the equivalent APIs from the managed namespace listed above. Keep app-specific Firebase configuration, such as `GoogleService-Info.plist`, in the application project.

Binding-specific caveat: The native Firebase In-App Messaging Apple SDK can use beta native framework versions behind the aggregate Firebase package line. Keep the NuGet package line aligned with the rest of Firebase in the application.

## Version Alignment

Firebase Apple SDKs are packaged as native xcframeworks. Applications should pin package versions intentionally and keep all `AdamE.Firebase.iOS.*` packages on the same major/minor Firebase line.

Avoid mixing unrelated Firebase binding package sets or mismatched Firebase native SDK lines in one application. That can cause duplicate symbols, linker failures, runtime loading failures, or undefined native SDK behavior.

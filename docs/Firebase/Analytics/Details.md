Firebase Analytics is a free app measurement solution that provides insight on app usage and user engagement.

At the heart of Firebase is Firebase Analytics, a free and unlimited analytics solution. Analytics integrates across Firebase features and provides you with unlimited reporting for up to 500 distinct events that you can define using the Firebase SDK. Analytics reports help you understand clearly how your users behave, which enables you to make informed decisions regarding app marketing and performance optimizations.

|-:|-|
| **Unlimited Reporting:**   | Firebase Analytics provides unlimited reporting on up to 500 distinct events. |
| **Audience Segmentation:** | Custom audiences can be defined in the Firebase console based on device data, custom events, or user properties. These audiences can be used with other Firebase features when targeting new features or notifications messages. |

## How does it work?

Firebase Analytics helps you understand how people use your iOS app. The SDK automatically captures a number of events and user properties and also allows you to define your own custom events to measure the things that uniquely matter to your business. Once the data is captured, it's available in a dashboard through the Firebase console. This dashboard provides detailed insights about your data â€” from summary data such as active users and demographics, to more detailed data such as identifying your most purchased items.

Analytics also integrates with a number of other Firebase features. For example, it automatically logs events that correspond to notification messages sent via the Notifications composer and provides reporting on the impact of each campaign.

Firebase Analytics helps you understand how your users behave, so you can make informed decisions about how to market your app. See the performance of your campaigns across organic and paid channels to understand which methods are most effective at driving high-value users. If you need to perform custom analysis or join your data with other sources you can link your Analytics data to BigQuery, which allows for more complex analysis like querying large data sets and joining multiple data sources.
